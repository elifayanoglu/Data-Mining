Hastane içi mortalite referanslı ölüm teşhisi tahminleyen modellerin karşılaştırılması  
Comparison of models predicting in-hospital mortality-referenced death diagnoses

# Dataset

This repo consists of two stages, preprocessing and models.
# Preprocessing Phase
In the preprocessing phase, after the steps of converting all values in the dataset to numeric values with the encoding method, filling in null values, and calculating correlations, the status of the dataset was revealed with various visual graphics.

# Models Phase
In the models phase, the preprocessed data set was trained with SVM, Logistic Regression and SGD Classifier models, respectively, and confusion matrices were extracted, thus making it easier to compare the estimation successes of these models.
